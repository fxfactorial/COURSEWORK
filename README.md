# COURSEWORK
Some of my undergraduate math and statistics coursework. All courses except for MATH 128A (Berkeley Summer 2016) were completed at UCLA 2016-2017. Problem set solutions are only included if I had time that week to typeset the solutions.

# MATHEMATICS COURSEWORK
* Real Analysis (MATH 131AH, MATH 131B)
* Numerical Analysis (MATH 128A -- BERKELEY)
* Algorithms (MATH 182)
* Probability (MATH 170A, STATS 200A)

# STATISTICS COURSEWORK
* Mathematical Statistics (STATS 100B)
* Linear Models (STATS 100C)
* Data Mining (STATS 101C)

Disclaimer: A lot of the problem sets, especially the math ones, are not without mistakes. These are meant to be used as reference only, so if you want to learn, you should probably still do your own work. Enjoy!
